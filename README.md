# Notes
* At first the model had 2 problems: running into walls and being unable to find the apple
* These were solved in time, but with this another problem was created that the model seemed unable to figure out in the time I provided
* It seems to struggle a lot with running into itself once it became long enough
* Towards the end of training it was spot on with targeting apples and no longer ran into walls
* However running into itself was a problem that held it back from getting really high scores
* Its high score was 51!
